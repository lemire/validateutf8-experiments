// UTF-8 Refresher
// ---------------
//
// UTF-8 is designed to allow multiple bytes and be compatible with ASCII. It's a fairly basic
// encoding that uses the first few bits on each byte to denote a "byte type", and all other bits
// are straight up concatenated into the final value. The first byte of a multibyte character is a
// "leading byte" and starts with N 1's, where N is the total number of bytes (110_____ = 2 byte
// lead). The remaining bytes of a multibyte character all start with 10. 1-byte characters just
// start with 0, because that's what ASCII looks like. Here's what each size 
//
// | Character Length            | UTF-8 Byte Sequence                   |
// |-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
// | ASCII (7 bits):             | `0_______`                            |
// | 2 byte character (11 bits)  | `110_____ 10______`                   |
// | 3 byte character (17 bits)  | `1110____ 10______ 10______`          |
// | 4 byte character (23 bits)  | `11110___ 10______ 10______ 10______` |
// | 5+ byte character (illegal) | `11111___` <illegal>                  |
//
// UTF-8 Error Classes
// -------------------
//
// There are 5 classes of error that can happen in UTF-8:
//
// ### Too short (missing continuations)
//
// TOO_SHORT: when you have a multibyte character with too few bytes (i.e. missing continuation).
// We detect this by looking for new characters (lead bytes) inside the range of a multibyte
// character.
//
// e.g. `11000000 01100001` (2-byte character where second byte is ASCII)
//
// ### Too long (stray continuations)
//
// TOO_LONG: when there are more bytes in your character than you need (i.e. extra continuation).
// We detect this by requiring that the next byte after your multibyte character be a new
// character--so a continuation after your character is wrong.
//
// e.g. `11011111 10111111 10111111` (2-byte character followed by *another* continuation byte)
//
// ### Too large (out of range for unicode)
//
// TOO_LARGE: Unicode only goes up to U+10FFFF. These characters are too large.
//
// e.g. `11110111 10111111 10111111 10111111` (bigger than 10FFFF).
//
// ### Overlong encoding (used more bytes than needed)
//
// Multibyte characters with a bunch of leading zeroes, where you could have
// used fewer bytes to make the same character, are considered *overlong encodings*. They are
// disallowed in UTF-8 to ensure there is only one way to write a single Unicode codepoint, making strings
// easier to search. Like encoding an ASCII character in 2 bytes is technically possible, but UTF-8
// disallows it so that you only have to search for the ASCII character `a` to find it.
//
// e.g. `11000001 10100001` (2-byte encoding of "a", which only requires 1 byte: 01100001)
//
// ### Surrogate characters
//
// Unicode U+D800-U+DFFF is a *surrogate* character, reserved for use in UCS-2 and WTF-8 encodings
// for characters with > 2 bytes. These are illegal in pure UTF-8.
//
// e.g. `11101101 10100000 10000000` (U+D800)
//
// ### 5+ byte characters
// 
// INVALID_5_BYTE: 5-byte, 6-byte, 7-byte and 8-byte characters are unsupported; Unicode does not
// support values with more than 23 bits (which a 4-byte character supports).
//
// Even if these were supported, anything with 5 bytes would be either too large (bigger than the
// Unicode max value), or overlong (could fit in 4+ bytes).
//
// e.g. `11111000 10100000 10000000 10000000 10000000` (U+800000)
//

//  | U+0000..U+007F     | 00..7F |        |        |        |

// Algorithm
// ---------
//
// This validator works in two basic steps: checking continuation bytes, and
// handling special cases. Each step works on one vector's worth of input
// bytes at a time.

  //
  // Check for missing / extra continuation bytes.
  //
  // The continuation bytes are handled in a fairly straightforward manner in
  // the scalar domain. A mask is created from the input byte vector for each
  // of the highest four bits of every byte. The first mask allows us to quickly
  // skip pure ASCII input vectors, which have no bits set. The first and
  // (inverted) second masks together give us every continuation byte (10xxxxxx).
  // The other masks are used to find prefixes of multi-byte code points (110,
  // 1110, 11110). For these, we keep a "required continuation" mask, by shifting
  // these masks 1, 2, and 3 bits respectively forward in the byte stream. That
  // is, we take a mask of all bytes that start with 11, and shift it left one
  // bit forward to get the mask of all the first continuation bytes, then do the
  // same for the second and third continuation bytes. Here's an example input
  // sequence along with the corresponding masks:
  //
  //   bytes:        61 C3 80 62 E0 A0 80 63 F0 90 80 80 00
  //   code points:  61|C3 80|62|E0 A0 80|63|F0 90 80 80|00
  //   # of bytes:   1 |2  - |1 |3  -  - |1 |4  -  -  - |1
  //   cont. mask 1: -  -  1  -  -  1  -  -  -  1  -  -  -
  //   cont. mask 2: -  -  -  -  -  -  1  -  -  -  1  -  -
  //   cont. mask 3: -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  1  -
  //   cont. mask *: 0  0  1  0  0  1  1  0  0  1  1  1  0
  //
  // The final required continuation mask is then compared with the mask of
  // actual continuation bytes, and must match exactly in valid UTF-8. The only
  // complication in this step is that the shifted masks can cross vector
  // boundaries, so we need to keep a "carry" mask of the bits that were shifted
  // past the boundary in the last loop iteration.
  //
  really_inline void check_length_errors(const simd8<uint8_t> bytes, const vmask_t bit_7) {
    // Compute the continuation byte mask by finding bytes that start with
    // 11x, 111x, and 1111. For each of these prefixes, we get a bitmask
    // and shift it forward by 1, 2, or 3. This loop should be unrolled by
    // the compiler, and the (n == 1) branch inside eliminated.
    //
    // NOTE (@jkeiser): I unrolled the for(i=1..3) loop because I don't trust compiler unrolling
    // anymore. This should be exactly equivalent and yield the same optimizations (and also lets
    // us rearrange statements if we so desire).

    // We add the shifted mask here instead of ORing it, which would
    // be the more natural operation, so that this line can be done
    // with one lea. While adding could give a different result due
    // to carries, this will only happen for invalid UTF-8 sequences,
    // and in a way that won't cause it to pass validation. Reasoning:
    // Any bits for required continuation bytes come after the bits
    // for their leader bytes, and are all contiguous. For a carry to
    // happen, two of these bit sequences would have to overlap. If
    // this is the case, there is a leader byte before the second set
    // of required continuation bytes (and thus before the bit that
    // will be cleared by a carry). This leader byte will not be
    // in the continuation mask, despite being required. QEDish.

  // Check for special-case errors with table lookups on the first 3 nibbles (first 2 bytes).
  //
  // Besides the basic prefix coding of UTF-8, there are several invalid byte
  // sequences that need special handling. These are due to three factors:
  // code points that could be described in fewer bytes, code points that are
  // part of a surrogate pair (which are only valid in UTF-16), and code points
  // that are past the highest valid code point U+10FFFF.
  //
  // All of the invalid sequences can be detected by independently observing
  // the first three nibbles of each code point. Since AVX2 can do a 4-bit/16-byte
  // lookup in parallel for all 32 bytes in a vector, we can create bit masks
  // for all of these error conditions, look up the bit masks for the three
  // nibbles for all input bytes, and AND them together to get a final error mask,
  // that must be all zero for valid UTF-8. This is somewhat complicated by
  // needing to shift the error masks from the first and second nibbles forward in
  // the byte stream to line up with the third nibble.
  //

  //   D     0..F  8..B  D0..DF are valid with a continuation byte
  //   E     0     A..B  E0 8x and E0 9x can be encoded with 2 bytes
  //         1..C  8..B  E1..EC are valid with continuation bytes
  //         D     8..9  ED Ax and ED Bx correspond to surrogate pairs
  //         E..F  8..B  EE..EF are valid with continuation bytes
  //   F     0     9..B  F0 8x can be encoded with 3 bytes
  //         1..3  8..B  F1..F3 are valid with continuation bytes
  //         4     8     F4 8F BF BF is the maximum valid code point
  //
  // That leaves us with these invalid sequences, which would otherwise fit
  // into UTF-8's prefix encoding. Each of these invalid sequences needs to
  // be detected separately, with their own bits in the error mask.
  //
