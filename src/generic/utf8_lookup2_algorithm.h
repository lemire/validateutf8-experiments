//
// Detect Unicode errors.
//
// UTF-8 is designed to allow multiple bytes and be compatible with ASCII. It's a fairly basic
// encoding that uses the first few bits on each byte to denote a "byte type", and all other bits
// are straight up concatenated into the final value. The first byte of a multibyte character is a
// "leading byte" and starts with N 1's, where N is the total number of bytes (110_____ = 2 byte
// lead). The remaining bytes of a multibyte character all start with 10. 1-byte characters just
// start with 0, because that's what ASCII looks like. Here's what each size looks like:
//
// - ASCII (7 bits):              0_______
// - 2 byte character (11 bits):  110_____ 10______
// - 3 byte character (17 bits):  1110____ 10______ 10______
// - 4 byte character (23 bits):  11110___ 10______ 10______ 10______
// - 5+ byte character (illegal): 11111___ <illegal>
//
// There are 5 classes of error that can happen in Unicode:
//
// - TOO_SHORT: when you have a multibyte character with too few bytes (i.e. missing continuation).
//   We detect this by looking for new characters (lead bytes) inside the range of a multibyte
//   character.
//
//   e.g. 11000000 01100001 (2-byte character where second byte is ASCII)
//
// - TOO_LONG: when there are more bytes in your character than you need (i.e. extra continuation).
//   We detect this by requiring that the next byte after your multibyte character be a new
//   character--so a continuation after your character is wrong.
//
//   e.g. 11011111 10111111 10111111 (2-byte character followed by *another* continuation byte)
//
// - TOO_LARGE: Unicode only goes up to U+10FFFF. These characters are too large.
//
//   e.g. 11110111 10111111 10111111 10111111 (bigger than 10FFFF).
//
// - OVERLONG: multibyte characters with a bunch of leading zeroes, where you could have
//   used fewer bytes to make the same character. Like encoding an ASCII character in 4 bytes is
//   technically possible, but UTF-8 disallows it so that there is only one way to write an "a".
//
//   e.g. 11000001 10100001 (2-byte encoding of "a", which only requires 1 byte: 01100001)
//
// - SURROGATE: Unicode U+D800-U+DFFF is a *surrogate* character, reserved for use in UCS-2 and
//   WTF-8 encodings for characters with > 2 bytes. These are illegal in pure UTF-8.
//
//   e.g. 11101101 10100000 10000000 (U+D800)
//
// - INVALID_5_BYTE: 5-byte, 6-byte, 7-byte and 8-byte characters are unsupported; Unicode does not
//   support values with more than 23 bits (which a 4-byte character supports).
//
//   e.g. 11111000 10100000 10000000 10000000 10000000 (U+800000)

  //
  // Algorithm
  // =========
  //
  // This algorithm compares *expected* continuation characters with *actual* continuation bytes,
  // and emits an error anytime there is a mismatch.
  //
  // For example, in the string "ùÑû‚Çø÷èab", which has a 4-, 3-, 2- and 1-byte
  // characters, the file will look like this:
  //
  // | Character             | ùÑû  |    |    |    | ‚Çø  |    |    | ÷è  |    | a  | b  |
  // |-----------------------|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
  // | Character Length      |  4 |    |    |    |  3 |    |    |  2 |    |  1 |  1 |
  // | Byte                  | F0 | 9D | 84 | 9E | E2 | 82 | BF | D6 | 8F | 61 | 62 |
  // | is_second_byte        |    |  X |    |    |    |  X |    |    |  X |    |    |
  // | is_third_byte         |    |    |  X |    |    |    |  X |    |    |    |    |
  // | is_fourth_byte        |    |    |    |  X |    |    |    |    |    |    |    |
  // | expected_continuation |    |  X |  X |  X |    |  X |  X |    |  X |    |    |
  // | is_continuation       |    |  X |  X |  X |    |  X |  X |    |  X |    |    |
  //
  // The errors here are basically (Second Byte OR Third Byte OR Fourth Byte == Continuation):
  //
  // - **Extra Continuations:** Any continuation that is not a second, third or fourth byte is not
  //   part of a valid 2-, 3- or 4-byte character and is thus an error. It could be that it's just
  //   floating around extra outside of any character, or that there is an illegal 5-byte character,
  //   or maybe it's at the beginning of the file before any characters have started; but it's an
  //   error in all these cases.
  // - **Missing Continuations:** Any second, third or fourth byte that *isn't* a continuation is an error, because that means
  //   we started a new character before we were finished with the current one.
  //
  // Getting the Previous Bytes
  // --------------------------
  //
  // Because we want to know if a byte is the *second* (or third, or fourth) byte of a multibyte
  // character, we need to "shift the bytes" to find that out. This is what they mean:
  //
  // - `is_continuation`: if the current byte is a continuation.
  // - `is_second_byte`: if 1 byte back is the start of a 2-, 3- or 4-byte character.
  // - `is_third_byte`: if 2 bytes back is the start of a 3- or 4-byte character.
  // - `is_fourth_byte`: if 3 bytes back is the start of a 4-byte character.
  //
  // We use shuffles to go n bytes back, selecting part of the current `input` and part of the
  // `prev_input` (search for `.prev<1>`, `.prev<2>`, etc.). These are passed in by the caller
  // function, because the 1-byte-back data is used by other checks as well.
  //
  // Getting the Continuation Mask
  // -----------------------------
  //
  // Once we have the right bytes, we have to get the masks. To do this, we treat UTF-8 bytes as
  // numbers, using signed `<` and `>` operations to check if they are continuations or leads.
  // In fact, we treat the numbers as *signed*, partly because it helps us, and partly because
  // Intel's SIMD presently only offers signed `<` and `>` operations (not unsigned ones).
  //
  // In UTF-8, bytes that start with the bits 110, 1110 and 11110 are 2-, 3- and 4-byte "leads,"
  // respectively, meaning they expect to have 1, 2 and 3 "continuation bytes" after them.
  // Continuation bytes start with 10, and ASCII (1-byte characters) starts with 0.
  //
  // When treated as signed numbers, they look like this:
  //
  // | Type         | High Bits  | Binary Range | Signed |
  // |--------------|------------|--------------|--------|
  // | ASCII        | `0`        | `01111111`   |   127  |
  // |              |            | `00000000`   |     0  |
  // | 4+-Byte Lead | `1111`     | `11111111`   |    -1  |
  // |              |            | `11110000    |   -16  |
  // | 3-Byte Lead  | `1110`     | `11101111`   |   -17  |
  // |              |            | `11100000    |   -32  |
  // | 2-Byte Lead  | `110`      | `11011111`   |   -33  |
  // |              |            | `11000000    |   -64  |
  // | Continuation | `10`       | `10111111`   |   -65  |
  // |              |            | `10000000    |  -128  |
  //
  // This makes it pretty easy to get the continuation mask! It's just a single comparison:
  //
  // ```
  // is_continuation = input < -64`
  // ```
  //
  // We can do something similar for the others, but it takes two comparisons instead of one: "is
  // the start of a 4-byte character" is `< -32` and `> -65`, for example. And 2+ bytes is `< 0` and
  // `> -64`. Surely we can do better, they're right next to each other!
  //
  // Getting the is_xxx Masks: Shifting the Range
  // --------------------------------------------
  //
  // Notice *why* continuations were a single comparison. The actual *range* would require two
  // comparisons--`< -64` and `> -129`--but all characters are always greater than -128, so we get
  // that for free. In fact, if we had *unsigned* comparisons, 2+, 3+ and 4+ comparisons would be
  // just as easy: 4+ would be `> 239`, 3+ would be `> 223`, and 2+ would be `> 191`.
  //
  // Instead, we add 128 to each byte, shifting the range up to make comparison easy. This wraps
  // ASCII down into the negative, and puts 4+-Byte Lead at the top:
  //
  // | Type                 | High Bits  | Binary Range | Signed |
  // |----------------------|------------|--------------|-------|
  // | 4+-Byte Lead (+ 127) | `0111`     | `01111111`   |   127 |
  // |                      |            | `01110000    |   112 |
  // |----------------------|------------|--------------|-------|
  // | 3-Byte Lead (+ 127)  | `0110`     | `01101111`   |   111 |
  // |                      |            | `01100000    |    96 |
  // |----------------------|------------|--------------|-------|
  // | 2-Byte Lead (+ 127)  | `010`      | `01011111`   |    95 |
  // |                      |            | `01000000    |    64 |
  // |----------------------|------------|--------------|-------|
  // | Continuation (+ 127) | `00`       | `00111111`   |    63 |
  // |                      |            | `00000000    |     0 |
  // |----------------------|------------|--------------|-------|
  // | ASCII (+ 127)        | `1`        | `11111111`   |    -1 |
  // |                      |            | `10000000`   |  -128 |
  // |----------------------|------------|--------------|-------|
  // 
  // *Now* we can use signed `>` on all of them:
  //
  // ```
  // prev1 = input.prev<1>
  // prev2 = input.prev<2>
  // prev3 = input.prev<3>
  // prev1_flipped = input.prev<1>(prev_input) ^ 0x80; // Same as `+ 128`
  // prev2_flipped = input.prev<2>(prev_input) ^ 0x80; // Same as `+ 128`
  // prev3_flipped = input.prev<3>(prev_input) ^ 0x80; // Same as `+ 128`
  // is_second_byte = prev1_flipped > 63;  // 2+-byte lead
  // is_third_byte  = prev2_flipped > 95;  // 3+-byte lead
  // is_fourth_byte = prev3_flipped > 111; // 4+-byte lead
  // ```
  //
  // NOTE: we use `^ 0x80` instead of `+ 128` in the code, which accomplishes the same thing, and even takes the same number
  // of cycles as `+`, but on many Intel architectures can be parallelized better (you can do 3
  // `^`'s at a time on Haswell, but only 2 `+`'s).
  //
  // That doesn't look like it saved us any instructions, did it? Well, because we're adding the
  // same number to all of them, we can save one of those `+ 128` operations by assembling
  // `prev2_flipped` out of prev 1 and prev 3 instead of assembling it from input and adding 128
  // to it. One more instruction saved!
  //
  // ```
  // prev1 = input.prev<1>
  // prev3 = input.prev<3>
  // prev1_flipped = prev1 ^ 0x80; // Same as `+ 128`
  // prev3_flipped = prev3 ^ 0x80; // Same as `+ 128`
  // prev2_flipped = prev1_flipped.concat<2>(prev3_flipped): // <shuffle: take the first 2 bytes from prev1 and the rest from prev3  
  // ```
  //
  // ### Bringing It All Together: Detecting the Errors
  //
  // At this point, we have `is_continuation`, `is_first_byte`, `is_second_byte` and `is_third_byte`.
  // All we have left to do is check if they match!
  //
  // ```
  // return (is_second_byte | is_third_byte | is_fourth_byte) ^ is_continuation;
  // ```
  //
  // But wait--there's more. The above statement is only 3 operations, but they *cannot be done in
  // parallel*. You have to do 2 `|`'s and then 1 `&`. Haswell, at least, has 3 ports that can do
  // bitwise operations, and we're only using 1!
  //
  // Epilogue: Addition For Booleans
  // -------------------------------
  //
  // There is one big case the above code doesn't explicitly talk about--what if is_second_byte
  // and is_third_byte are BOTH true? That means there is a 3-byte and 2-byte character right next
  // to each other (or any combination), and the continuation could be part of either of them!
  // Our algorithm using `&` and `|` won't detect that the continuation byte is problematic.
  //
  // Never fear, though. If that situation occurs, we'll already have detected that the second
  // leading byte was an error, because it was supposed to be a part of the preceding multibyte
  // character, but it *wasn't a continuation*.
  //
  // We could stop here, but it turns out that we can fix it using `+` and `-` instead of `|` and
  // `&`, which is both interesting and possibly useful (even though we're not using it here). It
  // exploits the fact that in SIMD, a *true* value is -1, and a *false* value is 0. So those
  // comparisons were giving us numbers!
  //
  // Given that, if you do `is_second_byte + is_third_byte + is_fourth_byte`, under normal
  // circumstances you will either get 0 (0 + 0 + 0) or -1 (-1 + 0 + 0, etc.). Thus,
  // `(is_second_byte + is_third_byte + is_fourth_byte) - is_continuation` will yield 0 only if
  // *both* or *neither* are 0 (0-0 or -1 - -1). You'll get 1 or -1 if they are different. Because
  // *any* nonzero value is treated as an error (not just -1), we're just fine here :)
  //
  // Further, if *more than one* multibyte character overlaps,
  // `is_second_byte + is_third_byte + is_fourth_byte` will be -2 or -3! Subtracting `is_continuation`
  // from *that* is guaranteed to give you a nonzero value (-1, -2 or -3). So it'll always be
  // considered an error.
  //
  // One reason you might want to do this is parallelism. ^ and | are not associative, so
  // (A | B | C) ^ D will always be three operations in a row: either you do A | B -> | C -> ^ D, or
  // you do B | C -> | A -> ^ D. But addition and subtraction *are* associative: (A + B + C) - D can
  // be written as `(A + B) + (C - D)`. This means you can do A + B and C - D at the same time, and
  // then adds the result together. Same number of operations, but if the processor can run
  // independent things in parallel (which most can), it runs faster.
  //
  // This doesn't help us on Intel, but might help us elsewhere: on Haswell, at least, | and ^ have
  // a super nice advantage in that more of them can be run at the same time (they can run on 3
  // ports, while + and - can run on 2)! This means that we can do A | B while we're still doing C,
  // saving us the cycle we would have earned by using +. Even more, using an instruction with a
  // wider array of ports can help *other* code run ahead, too, since these instructions can "get
  // out of the way," running on a port other instructions can't.
  // 
  // Epilogue II: One More Trick
  // ---------------------------
  //
  // There's one more relevant trick up our sleeve, it turns out: it turns out on Intel we can "pay
  // for" the (prev<1> + 128) instruction, because it can be used to save an instruction in
  // check_special_cases()--but we'll talk about that there :)
